# Heartbleed - Emulator of a Linux O.S

Heartbleed was the name of our practical work for the Operating Systems course, taught at the National Technological University of Buenos Aires.

This component completely emulates all the operations that an operating system has, such as the filesystem, the memory and the CPU.
It was made in order to understand how an operating system works.

> I do not leave any documentation since several of the libraries used in this component, as well as the linux version used to run it - are somewhat old and may be out of date. 

Anyway, you can dig into the repo and find some fun stuff.

have fun
